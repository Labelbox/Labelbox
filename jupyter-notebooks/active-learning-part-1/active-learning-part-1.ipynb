    "Machine learning as applied in non-academic settings is often an incredibly iterative process where the majority of time is spent managing and curating training data.  As accurately outlined by Andrej Karpathy:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/dataset.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning engineers spend most of time curating datasets for their models rather than tweak the models directly.  Engineers have to wade through large (often unbounded) unlabeled datasets while adhering to a budget for annotations and training cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to rely on an [active learning framework](http://burrsettles.com/pub/settles.activelearning.pdf) to surface the most informative examples to minimize annotation and training cycle constraints.\n",

    "A typical workflow looks like:\n",
    "1. Start with a small portion of the dataset labeled\n",
    "2. Train a classifier on our labeled dataset\n",
    "3. Prioritize a new batch of the dataset for labeling\n",
    "4. Retrain our classifier with the expanded labeled dataset\n",
    "5. Repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest method for choosing which datarows to prioritize is **uncertainty sampling**.  Under this paradigm, practicioners will define an uncertainty metric to capture datarows for which a model is least confident in its decision and prioritize those examples for annotation and training.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "[Queue customization](https://labelbox.com/docs/api/queue-customization#setting_queue_prioritization) in Labelbox is an incredibly simple way to start using active learning.  By prioritizing certain datarows for annotation, machine learning systems can achieve their goals with less annotation cost and fewer training cycles.  In many cases, the datarows that a model is uncertain of are also often more engaging to annotate and more important to review, allowing the human components of your machine learning system to spend their time on high impact decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern neural networks are deeper and datasets are larger, retraining may not be ideal or necessary.  Active learning is also a useful tool for transfer learning or finetuning frameworks.  Problems may also not be classifications but segmentation.  We encourage you to seek domain specific literature for inspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there are other ways of measuring uncertainty, such as classification entropy or classification margin.  Or your task might be include both [epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00218).  In fact, **uncertainty sampling** is far from the only way of surfacing informative examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ensemble-based approaches, disagreement sampling may be more useful, surfacing examples where the ensemble is highly disagreeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For datasets with a long tail of rare examples, diversity sampling proposes representative examples for prioritization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "The example covered here uses uncertainty sampling to address a binary sentiment classification problem.  What are some of your use cases?  How can Labelbox help:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Surface informative datarows\n",
    "1. Explore datarows on the decision boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "We would love to hear more about them!\n",
